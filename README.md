# [tabjy/packages](https://github.com/tabjy/packages)

my (semi-)private package registry for those rather trivial projects not worthing their own repositories. Use at your own risk :)

## Docker Images

### [ghcr.io/tabjy/hello-world](./docker/hello-world)

an alias tag to [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world) for exploring GitHub package/container registry

### [ghcr.io/tabjy/http-static](./docker/http-static)

a basic HTTP server for serving static file based on [h5ai](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai)

### [ghcr.io/tabjy/cross-tools-armv7l](./docker/cross-tools-armv7l)

an ubuntu based cross-compile toolchains for ARM development (as having them available natively in ArchLinux is a whole level of pains)

### [ghcr.io/tabjy/jdk11u-ci](./docker/jdk11u-ci)

a CI image with all dependencies for building/testing JDK 11
